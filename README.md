How we built it
Our product, designed for small to medium businesses, utilizes custom-built Python agents tailored to emulate an entrepreneurial assistant. Powered by a blend of large language models (LLAMA 3 8B, Mixtral 8x7B, and Gemini 1.0 Pro) for efficiency and GPT3.5 for precision, our platform offers five specialized assistants: inventory management, report analysis, web browsing, email handling, and catalog management.

Beneath the surface, a team of 23 agents operates seamlessly to support these assistants. These include Python agents, prompt agents, communicators, report generators, internet browsers, quality control monitors, memory processors, and more. Our approach draws from the ReAct research paper for agile and effective task execution.

Challenges we ran into
Building all necessary agents posed a significant challenge, exacerbated by the complexity of facilitating communication between them. Additionally, integrating and optimizing tools for these agents proved time-consuming.

Our core aim is to offer small business owners a straightforward solution without relying on complex methodologies.

We acknowledge the inverse relationship between user-end simplicity and developer-end complexity.

By employing advanced techniques such as complex regex, data retrieval, and intelligent agent collaboration, we have achieved seamless functionality.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Home-grown agents without any frameworks: Our development team has achieved a remarkable feat by creating home-grown AI agents without relying on external frameworks. This demonstrates our commitment to innovation and our confidence in our team's expertise. By building agents from scratch, we have full control over their functionality and can tailor them specifically to meet the needs of our users.

Robust Inventory Agent: We take pride in the creation of our robust Inventory Agent, which serves as a cornerstone of our platform. This agent is designed to efficiently manage inventory for businesses. Its reliability and effectiveness empower entrepreneurs to streamline their operations and make data-driven decisions with confidence.

One-stop report generation feature: Our platform offers a seamless solution for generating detailed PDF reports tailored for industry analysis. With just a few clicks, users can access a comprehensive array of data insights, trends, and performance metrics, compiled into professionally formatted reports. From market trends to competitor analysis, our report generation feature simplifies the process of gathering critical information, empowering users to make informed strategic decisions with ease. This streamlined approach saves valuable time and resources, allowing businesses to focus on driving growth and staying ahead of the competition.

Integration with third-party services: We have successfully integrated our platform with a wide range of third-party services, expanding its functionality and usability. This integration allows users to seamlessly connect with popular services and tools like Square, CSV files, Amazon Seller Data. By facilitating interoperability with external services, we enhance the versatility and value of our platform, catering to diverse business needs and preferences.

What we learned
How to make the custom agents and tailored tools that work together in order to ease the business owner. And also we learned how to use Pangea for building the most secure apps. We learnt how to use amazing tools like AuthN, Redact, Embargo, Vault, and audit log.

What's next for Up!
In the future, we are planning to further enhance the capabilities of "Up!" with tailored bots dedicated to specific use cases. These specialized agents will cater to specific business needs, such as a sales bot for the sales team, a staff bot for staff management activities or to address staff-related questions, a customer service bot for customers, and an ordering bot. This ensures optimization for each aspect of the business. Sellers only need to fill out a Google form specifying their needs and the category they require, and they will automatically receive an email of the bot that serves a particular purpose. We aim to remove all the hassle from the seller. Additionally, we plan to introduce workflow automation powered by AI, enabling sellers to streamline their operations effortlessly. With customizable workflows and simplified management, Up! empowers entrepreneurs to focus on growth and success while AI handles the rest.
